# @machinen/native-arm64-linux

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Complete the next live-mount compatibility slice by implementing virtio-fs `READLINK` and `LINK`, applying executable mode changes from `SETATTR`, and adding smoke coverage for symlink resolution, hardlinks, and `chmod +x` execution.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix virtio-fs `rmdir` on non-empty directories to return `ENOTEMPTY` instead of surfacing as guest `EIO`, and add directory-removal coverage for live mounts.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix virtio-fs live mounts writing to existing files.

  Writable opens now keep a read-capable host fd so Linux writeback-cache READ-fill requests on `O_WRONLY` handles do not surface as `EIO`. `SETATTR` now applies size truncation, and `RENAME` is implemented so `mv`/overwrite workflows work inside `--mount-live`.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Ship the virtio-fs live-mount transport and the vmstate snapshot pipeline.

  This release moves live mounts fully into the VMM via multi-slot virtio-fs, removes the old FUSE-over-vsock transport, consolidates the native host tools into the `@machinen/native-arm64-*` packages, and makes vmstate snapshots/restores the default path with asynchronous writes and faster restore handling.
