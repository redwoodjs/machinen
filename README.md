# Machinen by RedwoodSDK

This is a proof of concept.

Machinen is a browser-based text-editor that communicates with a Docker instance. The Docker instance is running a Vite dev server and RedwoodSDK. The point of this is to give developers a development environment in the cloud that can facilitate agentic workflows. A new instance can be created for each "Agentic workflow" so that they can work independently.

## Shortcomings

- Our editor is complete trash. We will improve it.
- We want you to be able to directly communicate with the container via VSCode Dev Containers.
- We need to include a way to save the changes permanently.
